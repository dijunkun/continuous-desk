Continuous Desk is a lightweight cross-platform remote desktop software. It allows multiple users to remotely control the same computer at the same time. In addition to desktop image transmission, it also supports end-to-end voice transmission, providing collaboration capabilities on the basis of remote desktop.

Continuous Desk is an experimental application of Projectx real-time audio and video transmission library. Projectx is a lightweight cross-platform real-time audio and video transmission library. It has basic capabilities such as network traversal ([RFC5245](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5245)), video software and hardware encoding/decoding (H264), audio encoding/decoding ([Opus](https://github.com/xiph/opus)), signaling interaction, and network congestion control ([TCP over UDP](https://libnice.freedesktop.org/)).


Among them, video encoding/decoding supports:
- OpenH264 software encoding/decoding
- NvCodec hardware encoding/decoding
- FFmpeg software encoding/decoding
